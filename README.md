# Android visual learning

I'm creating this project to create a mini tutorial for who want to learn Android.

The idea is to show an Android interface on web and, for each interaction, show what's going on and then redirect to the right documentation.

## How to use

If you want to run, at the moment I'm downloading dependencies on the same folder for include.

## Contribution

If you want to contribute, you can fork this project and improve, or if you know other projects that make the same thing, you can create an issue to let me know.


## Dependencies

For the interface: [marvelapp/devices.css](https://github.com/marvelapp/devices.css)
